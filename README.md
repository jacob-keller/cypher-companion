# cypher-companion

Cypher Companion is a character sheet tracker for the Cypher role playing
system. It is entirely client side, saving data in the web browser local
storage. No data is sent or received by a server.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

## Normal Use

You can load the application from Github Pages at [Cypher Companion](https://jacob-keller.github.io/cypher-companion).

The website automatically saves in the background using local storage. You
may also export the data as a JSON text file, or import such a file from
another web browser. The application is currently limited to tracking a
single character at a time.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
